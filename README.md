This script is dealing with Cisco device (Router/Switch). The main goal was to recover the running-configuration of many devices 

First, i had to connect to the device with a single command. For this, i used a CSV File which is containing IP, username and password of each devices. 

- Actually, the script allow to recover all the devices configuration one by one with the command "show running-config" which is input directly in the Cisco language and store the result to txt files.

- It would be cool to try to set an entire configuration by a script
